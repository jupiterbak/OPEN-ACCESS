***OPEN-ACCESS*** is an open source framework extending containerized application orchestration and device management to hosts at the Edge. It is built upon NodeJS and provides core infrastructure support for application deployment and datastream synchronization between cloud and edge. It also supports multiple communation protocols (AMQP, MQTT, REST, OPCUA, OPCUA pub/Sub, S7-Online, LCOM, ModBus-TCP, Mindsphere-Conect, ROS Messages, etc...) and allows developers to author custom logic and enable resource constrained device communication at the Edge.

## Introduction

A more detailed description of the architecture of OPEN-ACCESS is provided in the corresponding [paper](#citation).

***Fig. 1:*** *Architecture of a runtime engine.*

As illustrated in Fig. 1, OPEN-ACESS is modularly implemented using NodeJs (Javascript) and is composed of the following components:
  
### Southbound Module

The ***southbound module*** is responsible for raw data acquisition
from external systems including other instances of
OPEN-ACCESS. It is a collection of submodules called
southbound adapter. Each southbound adapter implements a
communication protocol and thus ensures the integration of
heterogeneous systems. An adapter can be configured as a
client to actively read, poll or monitor a data point from any
of the connected systems or as a server to receive published
data. Presented like this, each adapter instance represents a data stream. All data streams are integrated by the input bus, which the runtime engine can access.
  
### Runtime Engine

The ***runtime engine*** is responsible for the execution of
the data analytics algorithms defined in containers. Each
container is assigned a priority, a computation cycle time and
a maximum execution time. A container represents a Digital
Acyclic Graph (DAG), where the leaves of the graph define the
raw data, the node of the graph the operations and the nodes
with no parents the computation results. Each node can be
modeled explicitly using a mathematical function or implicitly
using a neuronal network for example. The runtime engine
schedules, executes and monitors the different containers,
suspending those containers, whose execution behavior differs
from its definition (e. g. execution time longer than expected).
Decoupling the containers also ensures that redundancy and
replication mechanisms for critical algorithms can be implemented.

### Northbound Module

The ***northbound module*** is responsible for the communication
of the computation results with an overlying system, e.g.
the cloud and/or other instances of the runtime engine. It is
also a collection of protocol adapters that can be configured
as client or server.

### Configurator

The ***configurator*** implements an OPC UA server and plays
the role of the knowledge aggregation server, which augments
the computation results with contextual information, e.g. the
multi-domain engineering information model representing the
production systemâ€™s architecture. It also manages the configurations
of the runtime engine and offers an interface to
manipulate the configuration of the algorithms, allowing an
online fine-tuning.

## Requirements

  * NodeJs : The Backend requires NodeJs and a node global package npm.  
  * Git  
  * Dockers: For a container installation, Docker is required. Please refer to the docker documentation for docker installation.  

## Installation

### NodeJS

Step 1: Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupiterbak/OPEN-ACCESS.git
cd OPEN-ACCESS
```

Step 2: Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Step 2: Start the application. Run the following

```bash
npm start
```

After a sucessfull startup the following output should be printed. Please notice the information that all modules have been sucessfully initialized and started.

```console

C:\GitHub\OPEN-ACCESS>npm start

> open_access@0.0.1 start C:\GitHub\OPEN-ACCESS
> node open_access.js

### Deploy as a Microservice using Docker

You can also deploy OPEN-ACCESS as a microservice inside a Docker container:

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupiterbak/OPEN-ACCESS.git
cd OPEN-ACCESS
```

Step 2: Build the Docker image

```bash
docker build -t open_access .
```

Step 3: Run the Docker container locally:

```bash
docker run -p 55554:55554 -d open_access
```

Step 3_a: Run the Docker container in the cluster:

```bash
sudo docker-compose build
```

```bash
docker stack deploy --compose-file swarm_deploy.yml OPEN_ACCESS_STACK
```

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage

In order to configure OPEN-ACCESS, the file ***default_settings.js*** has to be configured appropriately. For example the following configuration instantiate a S7-Online Client on the southbound to read some variable values on a Siemens PLC.

```javascript

example_config: {
    id: "SNAP7ClientDemo",      // Unique ID of the module in the global configuration
    name: "SNAP7ClientDemo",    // Name of the module instance.
    type: "SNAP7Client",        // Type of the module, should always be "SNAP7Client" in order to use this module
    modulesetting: {
        ip: '192.168.1.16',     // Remote IP-Address of the PLC server module
        rack: 0,                // PLC Rack number
        slot: 1,                // PLC Slot number
        interval: 1000,         // Interval to pool the data
    },
    outputs_variables: [        // The output variables specify how to interpret and map the data received
        {
            name: "Portal_Spannung_L1_N",   // Variable that will hold the serialized value comming from the PLC.
            datatype: "real",   // Type of the data to read: "real", "int", "byte"
            si_unit: "V",       // Unit of the data variable. It is optional
            area: 0x81,         // Area identifier (0x81 Process inputs, 0x82 Process outputs, 0x83	Merkers, 0x84 DB, 0x1C Counters,0x1D Timers)
            dbNumber: 21,       // DB number if area = 0x84, otherwise ignored
            start: 0,           // Offset to start
            amount: 100,        // Amount of words to read
            wordLen: 0x08       // Word size (0x01 Bit (inside a word), 0x02 Byte (8 bit), 0x04	Word (16 bit), 0x06	Double Word (32 bit), 0x08	Real (32 bit float), 0x1C	Counter (16 bit), 0x1D	Timer (16 bit))
        },
        {
            name: "Portal_Spannung_L3_N", // Variable that will hold the serialized value comming from the PLC.
            datatype: "real",   // Type of the data to read: "real", "int", "byte"
            si_unit: "V",       // Unit of the data variable. It is optional
            area: 0x81,         // Area identifier (0x81 Process inputs, 0x82 Process outputs, 0x83	Merkers, 0x84 DB, 0x1C Counters,0x1D Timers)
            dbNumber: 21,       // DB number if area = 0x84, otherwise ignored
            start: 0,           // Offset to start
            amount: 100,        // Amount of words to read
            wordLen: 0x08       // Word size (0x01 Bit (inside a word), 0x02 Byte (8 bit), 0x04	Word (16 bit), 0x06	Double Word (32 bit), 0x08	Real (32 bit float), 0x1C	Counter (16 bit), 0x1D	Timer (16 bit))
        }
    ]
}
